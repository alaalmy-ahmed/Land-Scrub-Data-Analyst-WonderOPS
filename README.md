### About WonderOPS
WonderOPS is a land investment company dedicated to leveraging technology to streamline and enhance its operations. The company's primary focus is on identifying and filtering properties quickly and efficiently using programming tools, APIs, and advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning. 

I was hired as a Data Analyst, but my role evolved into that of a Data Specialist, where I took charge of building a comprehensive "Data Scrub" project, encompassing the four key projects listed below. Additionally, I guided and mentored four interns—a Data Scientist, a Web Developer, and an AI Researcher—helping them align with company objectives. 

Beyond these projects, I developed a KPI Dashboard using Power BI to track monthly targets for various teams. The dashboard showcased key metrics, including new leads from cold calling, rows of data scrubbed, total offers, and progress in Phase II Due Diligence.
